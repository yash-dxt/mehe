## ðŸ’½ Database Design

Weâ€™ve got three collections, so far: 

*t**houghts*** & ***replies*** collection is linked to the ***users*** table using the username. 

Both, ***thought*** and ***replies*** have a status, which is one of the following - 

- PUBLISHED
- DRAFT
- REMOVED
- DELETED

**Some internals on indexing of MongoDB:** 

- In MongoDB the indexes come built in with the **_id** (the created at time can also be derived from them) so in each collections weâ€™ll have that **_id**. Also, this **_id** is always unique.
- Other than this we can have unique indexes (MongoDB also supports those) on **username** field in **users** collection.

âœ¨ MongoDB supports many many indexes. You can use **MongoDB Compass** to get an awesome view of Explain Plan to see if the indexes you intended to use are being used properly or not in your queries.
